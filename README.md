# Get Deep: Using 3D Depth and Skeletal Data in Three.js

This repository is for the ITP Camp 2018 Session on Kinectron and Three.js. 

## Session Description

You're so three dimensional in real life, why do you settle for just two dimensions in your internet life? In this session, we'll explore using real-time, three-dimensional (volumetric) images and skeletons in Three.js. We'll use Kinectron, an open-source tool to bring Kinect 2 data into the web and across networks to explore real-time 3D interactivity in the browser and across the world.

## Goals

The goal of this session is to give all participants an overview of what is possible with 3D interactive physical data in the browser. Although we will be using data from the Kinect 2, the methods will crossover to other methods of accessing skeletal and volumetric data. So, we're going to: 

* Learn what the data coming in looks like
* Learn how to access it
* Learn different ways for processing it
* Get examples to play with on your own! Woot
 
## Agenda 

* What is Kinectron 
* Kinect skeleton in 3D 
* 2D Textures on 3D objects
* Depth feed to point cloud
* Raw depth to point cloud 
* RGBD to Three-Kinectron library

## Getting started

1. What you need 

Make sure you have a text editor (like Sublime or Atom) and know how to access your terminal. 

2. Download or clone this repo

To clone the repo, open your terminal and enter the following commands

```
cd /Users/yourname/Desktop // this will put the downloaded folder on your desktop
git clone https://github.com/lisajamhoury/ITP-Camp-2018-Get-Deep.git

```

2. Run a local server 

```
cd /ITP-Camp-2018-Get-Deep
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

3. Open the entire training folder in a text editor
